# learn_flutter

This is a base Flutter project for me to use as a playground for testing flutter code quickly and with hot reload. It helps a lot to have my own repo since hot reload is an essential feature in designing views that is not so easily available in the main project. My goal in this tutorial is to finish a task of creating a view inside this sandbox and then moving the code over to the main app.
I'm doing this tutorial because this is basically my first time working with flutter and there are a lot of design schemas I need to take note of. Overall, I will be using this repository as not just a tutorial but also as a place for me to quickly develop designs that can be moved to the main repo.
